Python tool that scans IP ranges and detects open ports using Nmap.

IP Range & Port Scanner (Python + Nmap)
This project is a Python-based network scanning tool that allows users to scan IP address ranges and detect open ports using the powerful Nmap library through its Python binding, python-nmap.

It is designed for ethical hacking, cybersecurity testing, and network administration purposes. With this tool, you can quickly identify which hosts are online and which ports are open within a specified range.

Features
Scan a single IP or a range of IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.1-254)

Specify a port range (e.g., 20-80) for scanning

Detect open ports on each host

Lightweight CLI-based tool

Uses python-nmap for reliability and speed
